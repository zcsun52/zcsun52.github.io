## About Me

I'm a Masters student in Robotics, System and Control at <a href="https://ethz.ch/de.html" target="_blank"> ETH ZÃ¼rich</a>, studying under the supervision of Prof. Dr.<a href="https://rsl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.MTIxOTEx.TGlzdC8yNDQxLC0xNDI1MTk1NzM1.html" target="_blank"> Marco Hutter</a>. Prior to my current studies, I received my Bachelor's degree in Automation from the Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST) in 2020. In 2019, I had the opportunity to participate in an exchange program at MIT's EECS department. Following my bachelor's degree, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern in the iPad EE group at <a href="https://www.apple.com/careers/cn/" target="_blank"> Apple, China</a>. During this internship, I gained valuable experience in the entire process of taking an iPad from design to manufacture.



## Research Interests
My research interests lie in the fields of **autonomous driving** and **3D perceptions**. I am passionate about developing innovative solutions that enhance the safety, efficiency, and capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, I focus on leveraging advanced computer vision techniques to improve the perception and decision-making processes of autonomous systems.
